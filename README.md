## 💼 Professional Statement

I’m a Computer Science senior with a strong passion for both technology and helping people, two areas that naturally led me to cybersecurity. I believe one of the most meaningful things you can do in life is protect others, and cybersecurity lets me do that through the tools and systems I love working with.  

I’m currently pursuing the CompTIA Security+ and Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate to build a strong technical foundation while gaining a clearer, real-world view of how cybersecurity operates on a larger scale. I enjoy breaking down problems, finding patterns, and approaching challenges with a structured mindset. Above all, I bring enthusiasm, curiosity, and a proactive attitude to every project — and I hope to grow into a role where I can contribute to team success and lead by example.

## 🌟 Personal Story: How My Interest in Cybersecurity Began

Long before I began formally studying cybersecurity, I was unknowingly getting early exposure to it. My mother works at an airport and, being a native Spanish speaker, she often asked me to help her complete the Security Awareness and User Awareness trainings required for all employees. I started helping her with these online modules back in middle school and continued doing so throughout high school.  

At the time, I just thought of them as quick, easy quizzes that covered “common sense” topics — things like spotting “fishy” emails, creating strong passwords, avoiding suspicious links, and following workplace safety procedures. To me, growing up surrounded by technology, it all felt obvious and simple — but I now realize those lessons were actually teaching me the core principles of security awareness that professionals rely on every day.  

Looking back, it’s funny how those early experiences indirectly taught me the human side of security: that technology alone isn’t enough — awareness and consistent habits are just as critical. What once felt like basic workplace training has now become the foundation of my professional interest in cybersecurity.
